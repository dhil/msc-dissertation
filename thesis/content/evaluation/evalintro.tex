\chapter{Evaluation}\label{ch:evaluation}
Section \ref{sec:eval-abs} briefly summarises and evaluates handlers for algebraic effects using row polymorphism as an effectful programming model with respect to modularity and compositionality, and Section \ref{sec:eval-integration} evaluates to which extent handlers and user-defined effects coalesce with the Links language. Section \ref{sec:eval-performance} evaluates the relative performance cost incurred by handlers.
