\section{Proposed solution}\label{sec:proposedsolution}
The issues with existing models for effectful programming boil down to variants of the ordering problem as discussed in Section \ref{sec:mt}. Therefore we propose \emph{handlers for algebraic effects} with a small twist: to eliminate effect ordering we will use \emph{row polymorphism}. We discuss row polymorphism in greater detail in Section \ref{sec:rowpolymorphism}.

\subsection{Objectives, aim and scope}
The aim is to examine the programming model achieved by using handlers with row polymorphic effects.
In order to examine the model we must first implement it, thus the primary objective is to implement handlers and support for user-defined effects in Links.

Links is a web-oriented functional programming language that already has a row-based effect system in place. Because Links has built-in support for numerous web-oriented features that are not key to our treatment, we restrict the scope to a working implementation in top-level Links. We introduce the relevant aspects of Links in Section \ref{sec:links}.

\subsection{Contributions}
The main contributions are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item An implementation of effect handlers in Links.
  \item Support for row polymorphic user-defined effects in Links.
  \item An examination of programming with handlers and row polymorphic effects.
\end{itemize}
