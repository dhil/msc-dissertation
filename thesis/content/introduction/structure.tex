\section{Thesis structure}
The remainder of the report is structured as follows: Chapter \ref{ch:background} introduces row polymorphism, handlers and algebraic effects. Additionally, it contains a brief introduction to Links which covers the relevant constructs that we will use later on. Finally, it includes a discussion of related work.

Chapter \ref{ch:programming-with-handlers} dives right into programming with handlers in Links. A series of examples cover both closed and open handlers.

Chapter \ref{ch:implementation} gives a high level description of the implementation. Furthermore, the chapter discusses various design decisions.

Chapter \ref{ch:evaluation} evaluates handlers for algebraic effects using row polymorphism as a model for programming with effects. Moreover, the retrofitting of handlers and user-defined effects into Links is evaluated. Finally, the chapter contains a relative performance comparison between handler-based and pure programs.

Chapter \ref{ch:conclusion} concludes the work, and discusses future work.
