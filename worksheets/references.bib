  abstract = {
    We describe an extension of ML with  records where inheritance is
    given  by ML   generic  polymorphism.  All common  operations  on
    records but  concatenation are supported,    in particular the  free
    extension of records.  Other  operations such as renaming  of fields
    are added.  The solution relies on an extension  of ML, where the
    language of types is sorted  and considered modulo equations, and on
    a record extension of types.  The solution is simple and modular and
    the type inference algorithm is efficient in practice.
