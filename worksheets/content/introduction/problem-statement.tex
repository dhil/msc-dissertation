\section{Problem statement}
In the previous section we argued that programming with \emph{explicit} effect is desirable, but we pointed out that it is not  painless to program with explicit effects. In particular, we demonstrated that the monadic approach imposes an ordering on effects which impedes compositionality and modularity. Two key properties in programming which we ideally would like to retain along with explicit effects. This observation leads us to the following problem statement:
\begin{quote}
  \emph{How may we achieve a programming model for modular, composable and unordered effects?}
