\section{Proposed solution}\label{sec:proposedsolution}
Kammar et. al proposed that a row-based effect type system would yield a cleaner design \cite{Kammar2013}.

\subsection{Objectives, aim and scope}
The aim is to examine the programming model achieved by using handlers with row polymorphic effects.
In order to examine the model we must first implement it, thus the primary objective is to implement handlers and support for user-defined effects in Links.

Links has support for numerous web-oriented features, however we restrict the scope to a working implementation in top-level Links.

\subsection{Contributions}
The main contributions are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item An implementation of effect handlers in Links.
  \item Support for row polymorphic user-defined effects in Links.
  \item An examination of programming with handlers and row polymorphic effects.
\end{itemize}
